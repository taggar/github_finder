# github_finder

A group exercise in creating a small web interface to search for a github user and show key information about the user as well as the first 10 of the user's repositories on github.

Assignment: https://github.com/becodeorg/GNT-Yu-1.10/tree/master/2.The-Hills/4.Javascript-Project/Github-finder

Result: Originally implemented using xml-http-request, then re-implemented using graphql. Note that for a working version you must add a config.js file to the js folder containing a personal token to access the github api, as follows: 

```
var config = {
   personalToken: 'yourTokenAsProvidedByGithub'
};
```
